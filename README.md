# ReferenceCorrection
Crowd-sourced reference correction web app designed to improve medical research by correcting references in medical research papers.

How many times have you tried to chase up a reference only to find that the information is wrong? Or that the resulting paper does not justify the sentence? It is all too common and all too frustrating.

References are a fundamental part of a research paper but get very little attention. We all know they are important. They provide further information, justify comments and protect against plagiarism. But mistakes are frequent. A Cochrane review of referencing accuracy showed an average citation error rate of 38% (errors in the text details of the reference) and quotation error rate of 20% (errors of interpretation). (Wagner and Middleton, 2008)

This website helps to fix those problems. Correct the mistakes and help others to find the information they need.
