# ReferenceCorrection

###References are important. Help us fix them.

How many times have you tried to chase up a reference only to find that the information is wrong? Or that the resulting paper does not justify the sentence? It is all too common and all too frustrating.

References are a fundamental part of a research paper but get very little attention. We all know they are important. They provide further information, justify comments and protect against plagiarism. But mistakes are frequent. A Cochrane review of referencing accuracy showed an average citation error rate of 38% (errors in the text details of the reference) and quotation error rate of 20% (errors of interpretation). (Wagner and Middleton, 2008)

This website helps to fix those problems. Correct the mistakes and help others to find the information they need.

###How does this work?
ReferenceChecker relies on the users to post references from medical research papers (uploaded in a .ris or .enw format).

Users can then view these posts and submit their suggestion on how to fix a certain incorrect reference

These suggestions can be viewed and rated (agree or disagree) by other users.

The suggestions with the highest ratings (agreements) is always displayed at the top, which means users can easily find the best correction of an erroneous reference.

Each reference will have a status bar (green, orange, red) which indicates the validity of the reference based on the number of suggestions it has and its net ratings. For instance, if a reference has no suggestions, it will be assumed correct and the status bar will be green.
